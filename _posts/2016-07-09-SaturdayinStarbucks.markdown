Spending a whole day at starbucks is quite a decent time for me. I have enough drinks, good food, nice air con, wifi and good table. There is no such a good place to study in a cafe. 

It is always to meet some stangers here. Today I met a guy who draw pictures, he draws firetrunks, and many vechels in a really detail way. Though he is not so expert like a professional painter, I can still see how he put the time and effort into his paint. I said to him I cannot paint so well as you, and he just answered me "you can, all you need is little bit more time and several pencils and erasers, you can use erasers when you draw not so good." He is so right that I could not say more and he is so nice to show me his work. It is a nice file booklet, he also draws police car, helicopter, plane and other cool things. 

He says his father is a fire fighter, and he grew up in those firetrunks. I guess this may be the reason he is so familiar and interested in those veichles. He seems also have some friends in orange county police, I guess he may also be a police officer or retired veteran. He wears like military soldier who spends a relaxing weekend in spare time in the movie and he is also in a very strong and fit shape. 

Anyway, his attitu....

Okay, his name is David. the interesting thing is while I'm writing this post, he moved a chair besides me and watch my screen. I noticed him and said honestly to him I'm writing a post about you. We introduces ourself again and shaked hands. Now I don't have to guess and he told me his name. While we are talking, the outside passed a firetrunk, his eyes became shining somehow. I can see he really likes firetrunk. He also showed me another picture about a fire fighter was drawing. He said he can draw stuffs, but he still needs to practice with portrait of people. 

He said he become homeless since last December, he lives around and spend most of his time drawing those things in this starbucks. When He said this, I suddenly don't know what to say next, I don't know if it is proper to comfort him, even more, I even don't know what to say to comfort him cause I just talked a few words with him. He seems polite and don't want bother me. I said it is okay and really nice to know some new people like him. He replied me a smile. 

He said that he is so focus on his drawing, and could not do other things. But I can still see his passion in drawing and it is really a dream for me to find something to passion on just like him. Though facing the hardness in life, if there is a thing you can stick on, there is nothing to regret.

Wish him to find a nice place to live in the future.(and also wish me find a decent career).
