#Intro of week 1

##Supervised Learning
Already know what is right answer, what does result looks like. Trying to find if there is a relationship between input and output.

1.regression problem 

We are trying to predict a result in a continuous output. In other words, we are trying to map input variable to some continuous function.

Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem. 

2.classification algorithm

Asked to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map a input variable into a discrete categories.

SVM support vector machine

e.g.
(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture

(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

##Unsupervised learning
Input are not labeled. There is no feedback based on prediction results.

1.clustering algorithm

e.g. Google news cluster together as results. Understanding genes

Application: organize computing clusters, social network analysis, market segmentation, astronomical data analysis.

2. non-clustering
Cocktail party problem, to find structure in a chaotic environment.
