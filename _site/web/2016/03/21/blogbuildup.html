<p>1.js event delegation</p>

<p>event delegation is a simple way to handel events listeners to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes especially when child nodes are frequently changed. Event delegation can add listeners to parent rather than on child.</p>

<p>2.about <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code></p>

<p>When talking about <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code>, we have to talk about scope (作用域)，just like  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110725013125/http://www.digital-web.com/articles/scope_in_javascript/">This</a> article said: scope is a neighbor of code and effect each other. JS resolves identifiers by climbing up scope chain, locally to globally. So just like two friends are talking about their close person, not a famous but not close person. With this understading, <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> is based on scope thing. More generally, in OOP, <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> is a way to identify and refer to current working object and get properties of it. There are several scenario of using <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code>.</p>

<p>Calling an object’s method:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; 
  		var deep_thought = { 
    the_answer: 42, 
		ask_question: function () { 
		return this.the_answer; 
		} 
  	}; 
	var the_meaning = deep_thought.ask_question(); 
 	&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>in this code, When deep_thought.ask_question() is executed, JavaScript establishes an execution context for the function call, setting this to the object referenced by whatever came before the last ”.”, in this case: deep_thought.</p>

<p>constructor:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; 
  function BigComputer(answer) { 
   this.the_answer = answer; 
   this.ask_question = function () { 
	return this.the_answer; 
   } 
  } 

  var deep_thought = new BigComputer(42); 
  var the_meaning = deep_thought.ask_question(); 
 &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>On one hand, <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> meant “the new object.” On the other hand, we entered <code class="highlighter-rouge">the_question</code> via <code class="highlighter-rouge">deep_thought</code>, so while we’re executing that method, this means “whatever <code class="highlighter-rouge">deep_thought</code> refers to”. this is not read from the scope chain as other variables are, but instead is reset on a context by context basis.</p>

<p>Function Call:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; 
  function test_this() { 
   return this; 
  } 
  var i_wonder_what_this_is = test_this(); 
 &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> defaults to reference the most global thing it can: for web pages, this is the window object.</p>

<p>Event Handler:<br />
if the event handler is inline,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; 
  function click_handler() { 
   alert(this); // alerts the window object 
  } 
 &lt;/script&gt; 
 ... 
 &lt;button id='thebutton' onclick='click_handler()'&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt;  
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> refer to window object.</p>

<p>if it is not inline,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; 
  function click_handler() { 
   alert(this); // alerts the button DOM node 
  } 

  function addhandler() { 
   document.getElementById('thebutton').onclick = click_handler; 
  } 

  window.onload = addhandler; 
 &lt;/script&gt; 
 ... 
 &lt;button id='thebutton'&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> refers to the DOM element that generated the event.</p>

<p>3.prototypal inheritance</p>

<p>In JavaScript, the inheritance is prototype-based. That means that there are no classes. Instead, an object inherits from another object</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">__proto__</code> is to find parent object, also called prototype
<code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> is irrelevant to parent object
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Object.create(proto)</code> create object from proto
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)</code> get proto</p>

<p>4.What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS</p>

<p>AMD:Asynchronous Module Definitions</p>

<p>AMD takes a browser-first approach, using asynchronous behavior and backwards compatibility but doesn’t have a File I/O concept. It supports objects, functions, constructors, strings, JSON and many other types of modules, running natively in the browser. It can be used to lazy load / defer the loading of dependencies.</p>

<p>CommonJS on the other hand takes a server-first approach, assuming synchronous behavior, no globals and it attempts to cater for the future - server side. So, Common JS supports unwrapped modules, freeing you of the define() wrapper that AMD enforces.</p>

<p>5.IIFE</p>

<p>IIFE:Immediately-Invoked Function Expression <a href="http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/#iife">about IIFE</a><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">function foo(){ }();</code> this does not work in IIFE.</p>

<p>6.variable that null, undefined or undeclared</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code> is a object, <code class="highlighter-rouge">undefined</code> is a type of variable, means a variable has been declared but has not yet assigned with value. <code class="highlighter-rouge">undeclared</code> is used with no <code class="highlighter-rouge">var</code> , it gets created on global object(window), but will throw error 
how to check:</p>

<p>typeof check: <code class="highlighter-rouge">if(typeof someUndefVar == whatever)</code> 
can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">value = obj.prop || defaultValue</code> check undefinded properties</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>if ( some_variable == null ){
  // some_variable is either null or undefined
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>7.closure</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work">this article explains</a></p>

<p>a closure is the local variables for a function — kept alive after the function has returned, or
a closure is a stack-frame which is not deallocated when the function returns (as if a ‘stack-frame’ were malloc’ed instead of being on the stack!).<br />
A closure in JavaScript is like keeping a copy of all the local variables, just as they were when a function exited.</p>

<p>8.What’s a typical use case for anonymous functions?</p>

<p>An anonymous function is a function that was declared without any named identifier to refer to it. As such, an anonymous function is usually not accessible after its initial creation.</p>

<p>Use as an argument to other functions:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>setTimeout(function() {
  alert('hello');
}, 1000);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Above, the anonymous function is passed to setTimeout, which will execute the function in 1000 milliseconds.</p>

<p>Use as a closure:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(function() {
  alert('foo');
})();
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Breakdown of the above anonymous statements:<br />
The surrounding braces is a wrapper for the anonymous function<br />
The trailing braces initiates a call to the function and can contain arguments</p>

<p>Another way to write the previous example and get the same result:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(function(message) {
  alert(message);
}('foo'));
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>9.module pattern, classical inheritance</p>

<p><a href="http://metaduck.com/08-module-pattern-inheritance.html">this blog helps</a></p>

<p>10.What’s the difference between host objects and native objects?</p>

<p>Host objects: <br />
  Everything the environment gives you. For the browser, this includes objects like <code class="highlighter-rouge">window</code>.<br />
Native Objects:
  Native objects are inherent to JS<br />
User objects:
	User objects are anything the user defines. When you create a new object that is not directly a native object, you’ve made a user object.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Difference between: <code class="highlighter-rouge">function Person(){}</code>, var <code class="highlighter-rouge">person = Person()</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">var person = new Person()</code></li>
</ol>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">function Person(){}</code>:<br />
this defines a constructor, because in JS, a function start with capital letter usually indicates this is a constructor.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">person = Person()</code>:<br />
This is a mistake. There are ways of dealing with mistakes like this (one way is the “use strict” method), but ultimately this should be corrected.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">var person = new Person()</code>:
In traditional OOP this may refer to a new instance of <code class="highlighter-rouge">person</code> class, BUT in JS, using this method <code class="highlighter-rouge">person</code> will have access to everything <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person.prototype</code> has access to, as well as any instance variables set in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> constructor.</p>

<p>12.Function.prototype.bind</p>

<p>The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.</p>

<p><strong>always binding <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> will lose access to inner <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code></strong></p>
